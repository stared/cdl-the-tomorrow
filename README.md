# The Tomorrow - CDL Quantum Hackathon 2021

## Project Description

*(3-4 lines about what it is and how you did it)*

## Setup

The project is managed by [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). Install all dependencies by running in the command line:

```{bash}
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

If you want to run in in Jupyter Notebook, see [How to set up Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook the right way](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-set-up-anaconda-and-jupyter-notebook-the-right-way-de3b7623ea4a).

TODO: explicit steps for DWave setup

## How to Use

*Example: From command line: Use python solvers/script.py -h*
