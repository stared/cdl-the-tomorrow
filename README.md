# The Tomorrow - CDL Quantum Hackathon 2021

## Project Description

*(3-4 lines about what it is and how you did it)*

## Setup

The project is managed by [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). Install all dependencies by running in the command line:

```{bash}
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

If you want to run in in Jupyter Notebook, see [How to set up Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook the right way](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-set-up-anaconda-and-jupyter-notebook-the-right-way-de3b7623ea4a).

TODO: explicit steps for DWave setup

## How to Use

*Example: From command line: Use python solvers/script.py -h*

### Urban Planning

We can find sprawls in every city. It is not necessarily about the population size or class stratifications, these "disconnected environments" emerge in every part of the world as a result of flawed urban planning.
Peter Calthorpe, a well-known architect and urban planner, points out that this phenomenon accounts for "not just environmental impacts, but our social well-being, the economic vitality, our sense of community and connectedness" [[1]](https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_calthorpe_7_principles_for_building_better_cities).  Billions of dollars are spent on traffic optimization, respiratory and heart diseases, carbon footprint reduction, land consumption optimization, residential segregation mitigation (just to name a few common issues). And those problems are just evolving. Right now, more than half of the world's population already lives in cities, and another 2.5 billion people are projected to move to urban areas by 2050 [[2]](https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html). 

This, unfortunately, might lead to deplorable consequences:
> At the same time that we're solving for climate change, we're going to be building cities for three billion people. That's a doubling of the urban environment. If we don't get that right, I'm not sure all the climate solutions in the world will save mankind.
