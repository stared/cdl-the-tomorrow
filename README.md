# The Tomorrow - CDL Quantum Hackathon 2021

## Project Description

*(3-4 lines about what it is and how you did it)*

## Setup

The project is managed by [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). Install all dependencies by running in the command line:

```{bash}
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

If you want to run in in Jupyter Notebook, see [How to set up Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook the right way](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-set-up-anaconda-and-jupyter-notebook-the-right-way-de3b7623ea4a).

TODO: explicit steps for DWave setup

## How to Use

*Example: From command line: Use python solvers/script.py -h*

### Urban Planning

> “The problem with urban environments that are auto oriented,” he said, as we wound our way toward the Bay Bridge, “is that if there’s no choice, if the only way to get around is in a car, lo and behold, people are going to use cars too much. Too much for the climate, too much for people’s pocketbooks, too much for the community in terms of congestion, too much for people’s time. I mean, every way you measure it, it has a negative—no walking is a prescription for obesity. Air quality feeds into respiratory illnesses.” (c)
